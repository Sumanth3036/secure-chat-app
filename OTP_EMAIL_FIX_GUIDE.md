# üîß OTP EMAIL FIX GUIDE
## Why OTP is Not Reaching Email Inbox

---

## üö® CURRENT ISSUE

**Problem:** OTP is generated but not sent to user's email inbox

**Root Cause:** Your application is running in **CONSOLE MODE** (default setting)

**What's Happening:**

- ‚úÖ OTP is displayed in server console/logs
- ‚ùå OTP is NOT being sent to actual email addresses
- ‚ùå Users cannot receive OTP in their inbox

## üìä DIAGNOSIS

Your `email_service.py` is configured with 3 modes:

1. **Console Mode** (CURRENT - Default)
   - OTP only shows in server logs
   - No actual emails sent
   - Good for development/testing

2. **SendGrid Mode** (RECOMMENDED)
   - Sends real emails via SendGrid API
   - Free tier: 100 emails/day
   - Easy setup

3. **Gmail SMTP Mode** (Alternative)
   - Sends emails via Gmail
   - Requires App Password setup
   - More complex configuration
